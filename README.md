🧠 Neural Network Projects: Deep Dive into Deep Learning

📁 What’s in the Repo?

A collection of deep learning projects that went through 3 stages:

> ⚪ Idea → 🔵 Trial & Error → 🟢 “It finally works!”

🧪 Tech Stack

> “It’s not magic, it’s just matrix math.”

* 🐍 Python
* 🧠 TensorFlow & Keras (whichever mood strikes)
* 📊 NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* 🗂️ Google Colab – because tabs > semicolons

📚 Why This Exists

Because I got tired of saying “I know deep learning” and having nothing to show for it.
Now I can say “I *build* deep learning.”

“The best way to understand deep learning is to build it, break it, and build it again.”

Happy Coding 🧠✨
